#Another way association can be confused with causation is when the cause and effect are reversed.
#As discussed in the video, in the Galton data, when father and son were reversed in the regression, the model was technically correct.
#The estimates and p-values were obtained correctly as well. What was incorrect was the interpretation of the model.

# cause and effect reversal using son heights to predict father heights
