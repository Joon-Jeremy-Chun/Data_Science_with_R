#Predicted Variables are Random Variables
#The predicted value is often denoted as Y-hat, which is a random variable. Mathematical theory tells us what the standard error of the predicted value is.
#The predict() function in R can give us predictions directly.

# plot predictions and confidence intervals
galton_heights %>% ggplot(aes(father, son)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")

# predict Y directly
fit <- galton_heights %>% lm(son ~ father, data = .) 
Y_hat <- predict(fit, se.fit = TRUE)
names(Y_hat)

# plot best fit line
galton_heights %>%
  mutate(Y_hat = predict(lm(son ~ father, data=.))) %>%
  ggplot(aes(father, Y_hat))+
  geom_line()
