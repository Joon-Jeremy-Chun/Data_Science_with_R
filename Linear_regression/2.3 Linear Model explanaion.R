#Linear Models
#Key points
#"Linear" here does not refer to lines, but rather to the fact that the conditional expectations is a linear combination of kown quantities.

#In Galton's model, we assume Y (son's height) is a linear combination of a constant and X (father's hight) plus random noise.
#We further assume that (e_i) are independent from each other, have expected value 0 and the standard deviation (thita)  which does not depend on i.

#Note that if we further assume that (e) is normally distributed, then the model is exactly the same one we derived earlier by assuming bivariate normal data.
#We can subtract the mean from (X) to make(beta_0) more interpretable.
