#Objectives: To understand how to use Quantile-Quantile Plots(QQ-plots)

# define x and z
library(tidyverse)
library(dslabs)
data(heights)
index <- heights$sex=="Male"
x <- heights$height[index]
z <- scale(x)

# proportion of data below 69.5
mean(x <= 69.5)
#Outcome:0.5147783

# calculate observed and theoretical quantiles
p <- seq(0.05, 0.95, 0.05)
observed_quantiles <- quantile(x, p)
theoretical_quantiles <- qnorm(p, mean = mean(x), sd = sd(x))
# make QQ-plot
plot(theoretical_quantiles, observed_quantiles)
abline(0,1) #(y-axis,slope)
#Outcome: The table; its meaning -> each observed quantiles represent as each dots. And the line for theoretical 

# make QQ-plot with scaled values
observed_quantiles <- quantile(z, p)
theoretical_quantiles <- qnorm(p) 
plot(theoretical_quantiles, observed_quantiles)
abline(0,1)
